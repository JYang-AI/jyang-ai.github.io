:star: Our paper [Learning-Augmented Online Control for Decarbonizing Water Infrastructures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14232) has been accepted by **e-Energy'25**! 
This paper provides a learning-augmented control algorithm for a critical infrastructure: the municipal water supply systems. 
The algorithm guarantees the worst-case safety of water supply (e.g. for fire protection) while minizing the energy costs for pumping water.
