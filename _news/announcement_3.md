:star: Our paper [3D-Learning: Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning]() is accepted by **IEEE INFOCOM 2026**. This paper exploits diffusion models to construct the adversarail environments for Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO) problems and trains distributionally robust prediction models. Congratulations to Jiaqi.
