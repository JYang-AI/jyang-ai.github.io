Our paper [Online Allocation with Replenishable Budgets: Worst Case and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04340) was accepted by **ACM SIGMETRICS 2024**!  This paper provides fundamental algorithms with worst-case guarantees for online resource allocation problem and proposes a learning-augmented algorithm to improve the statistical performance under worst-case guarantee.
