I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/) at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu).
Prior to that, I was a visitor at Caltech and a postdoctoral research assistant at UC Riverside, working with [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com) and [Prof. Shaolei Ren](https://shaoleiren.github.io).
I received my PhD degree in 2023 at UC Riverside, advised by Prof. Shaolei Ren. 

My research interests span AI/ML algorithms and their applications in computing systems.
